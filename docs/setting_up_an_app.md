# API guide

## What can you do with the Deriv API?

The Deriv API allows you to perform nearly all functions of the Deriv platforms, since
they share the same API. For our CFD platforms (Deriv MT5 and Deriv X), the API
functionality is only available for some account management actions.

Our API users typically perform the following activities:

- Build websites similar to Deriv but with different features.
- Create desktop apps to execute trades for themselves and their clients.
- Explore historical tick information.
- Automate services as payment agents.

## How can you earn with Deriv API?

- You can earn commission on trades and payments your clients perform via
  the websites and apps you create with Deriv API. Get more details about the
  commission plans here.
- You can also earn from markups on every contract purchased via a trading
  app you created with Deriv API. The markup is defined by you and can be up
  to 5%.

Here is an example of how the markup is calculated:

- To get a payout of 2 USD: Client stake without markup = 1.07 USD
- With the markup (e.g. 2%), a client pays:Client's stake with the markup =
  Stake + (payout x markup)
- Client's stake with the markup = 1.07 USD + (2 USD x 2%) = 1.11 USD
