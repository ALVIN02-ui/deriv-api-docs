# Introduction

Our Documentation is divied in several sections:

- [Setting up a deriv app](/docs/application_setup.md)
- [Core Concepts](category/core-concepts)
- [Languages](category/languages)
- [Deriv Api client libraries](category/deriv-api)
- [Integration with Front-End Frameworks](category/frameworks)
- [Frequently Asked Questions](category/frequently-asked-questions)
- [Guides](category/guides)

### Quick Start

Please skim through our [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) pages, these pages will help get familiar with our `websocket server api` features, the concepts introduced in these pages are not related to any of our frameworks or libraries, so in order to use our `websocket server api` in an efficeint way it's better if you grasp all the information provided there.

When you're done with [Core Concept](category/core-concepts) you can choose your implementation approach based on the language / framework / library you want to work with in your application.

Using our [Deriv API Client Libraries](category/deriv-api) is optional and you can get the same result with the tutorials provided in [Languages Section](category/languages) as well, but our client libraries provide more `robust`, `type safe` API calls for you.

### Using our Websocket Server with Deriv API client libraries

Using our [Deriv API Clients](category/deriv-api) is the best approach for creating applications based on our `websocket api server`, in the future we will provide integrations for most of front end libraries and frameworks, you can check the progress in [here](category/frameworks)

### Using our Websocket Server with pure languages

If you decided that you want to use our `websocket server` with pure languages feature of your choice please check out [Languages Section](category/languages) continue your journey from there.

:::caution
We suggest using our [Client Libraries](category/deriv-api), since they give you better developer experience.
