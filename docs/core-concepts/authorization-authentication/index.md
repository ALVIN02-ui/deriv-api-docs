Without authentication and authorization you'll only get access to roughly half of our API calls and features. for example in order to buy contracts or utilize the \`Copy Trading\` features you have to authenticate and authorize your users.



## Requirements

1. Deriv Account
2. Deriv API Token with the appropriate access level.
3. Deriv App ID
